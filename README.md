## NOTE: The project is forked (copied) from the <a href="https://github.com/Phreshhh" target="_blank">user: (Phreshhh)</a>. <br> I have  only added ***skipping-scenes-functionality*** in it.

#### What is ***Skip-Scenes*** functionality?

The media-player will skip unwanted/inappropriate scenes ***(already defined in a `.skip` file)*** during a playback. So, everytime  user does not have to stay attentive for a scene to come then forward/skip the scene manually.

#### Reason?
Because other solutions like croping/cutting whole movies/videos are quite time & resource consuming.

## How to create a `.skip` file for a video:

1. Open notepad and define time-span(s) [which you want to skip automatically during a playback]:
* e.g:
* `00:00:07` - `00:00:08`
* `00:01:02` - `00:07:08`
* `00:02:26` - `00:02:26`

3. If there are more than one scenes, define them on new lines, like in the picture below:

4. Now save the file with the **same name** as your video file but with a **`.skip`** extension & then save the **`.skip`** file in the **same directory** as your video file:

<img src="https://github.com/abdulmoizhussain/PhreshPlayer/blob/custom/examples/p3.png" width="700" alt="Playing video">

6. Now, **drag-n-drop** the video file in Phreshh media player.
<img src="https://github.com/abdulmoizhussain/PhreshPlayer/blob/custom/examples/p5.png" width="700" alt="Playing video">

7. You will see **skip on/off** button at the bottom right corner of the player controls. From there you can turn skipping on or off.
**On means**: The scenes you have defined in the .skip file will be skipped automatically during playback.
**Off means**: The playback will be in normal flow, the scenes will not be skipped.

## Below is the documentaion of Phreshh player written by the <a href="https://github.com/Phreshhh" target="_blank">owner</a>.
<br><br>

Inspired by <a href="https://mpv.io/" target="_blank">mpv</a> player (with old hud) - I'm really liked it.. :( and <a href="https://potplayer.daum.net/" target="_blank">PotPlayer</a>.

Developed using <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron</a>.

**Keep It Simple!**

I'm sick of so much bullsh.t features in modern mediaplayers like kmp, vlc, etc.
Filters, useless view modes and more..

At last time I used PotPlayer but at this time is overhyped too.

The lot of extra features is it would be awesome, but finaly the program can't do that normally what it created first.
So I make my own..

I don't planning more features to the updates (exept audioTrack support/changes if will supported..), only neccessary bug fixes.

The Phresh media player is a simple and intuitive desktop app for Windows, Mac and Linux. It plays media files.. end of story.

In turn, I pays great attention to the naturality, easy and clear usage with much (and usual) keyboard shortcuts and some mouse gestures.

The player has an right click menu also for more powerful support the handling.

PhreshPlayer knows read the '.srt' subtitles also.

## A feature though!

Still I see today '.avi' and '.wmv' files, so..

.. if you drop an (or more) '.avi' or '.wmv' file into the player,
then convert files to '.mp4' automatically (and add it to playlist also automatically after conversion).

**WARNING! High CPU usage while converting.**

The conversion unfortunately work only Linux and Windows. As far as I know, not works on MacOS and the CPU limit works on Linux only.

### Supported file types
- mp4
- webm
- mkv (aac audio only. ac3 not, but you can convert to aac)
- m4v
- ogg (ogv)
- mov

- flac

|right click|menu open|

### File/Folder drops

|place|action|
|---|---|
|videoplayer area|clear actual playlist, and refill with the new files|
|playlist area|append files to the actual playlist|

The application can read folders also, but just 1 level deep:
- .
- ..
- Folder
  - Folder2
    - file level 3
  - file level 2
  - file2 level 2


- file  level 1
- file2 level 1

level 1 and level 2 files will append also to the playlist if you drop in at the same time, but  level 3 file in Folder2 won't.

### 'Sorry bro, no mana..'

The electron (and the original too) Chromium/Chrome currently not support multi audio tracks in html 5 video players, so the language change unavilable yet in multi language videos.. :(

*Unfortunately I can't test on MacOS, so if you want better support for Mac, buy me a MacBook.. :D .. Or write to me the problems and deficiency what you found and i'll try to fix it.*
